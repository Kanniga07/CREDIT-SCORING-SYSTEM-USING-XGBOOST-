# CREDIT-SCORING-SYSTEM-USING-XGBOOST-


This project focuses on developing a credit scoring system using XGBoost and LightGBM, two advanced machine learning models. The system evaluates an individual's or business's creditworthiness by analyzing financial and behavioral data such as credit history, income, debt, and repayment patterns. The models are trained on processed data to improve accuracy, scalability, and reliability while addressing common challenges like data imbalance and interpretability. The system integrates explainability techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to ensure transparency and can be deployed in real-time applications, making it useful for financial institutions to assess credit risk efficiently.
